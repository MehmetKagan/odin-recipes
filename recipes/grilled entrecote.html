    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Grilled entrecote is one of the easiest and tastiest dishes ever. With a couple of ingredients you can cook juicy,
        tasty and soft steak.
        </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>    
         <li> 250 grams of entrecote</li>
        <li>Sea salt</li>
        <li>Black pepper</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>            
            <li>Wrap the entrecote with a paper towel and wait 30 minutes. (We have to move blood from entrecote as much as possible.)</li>
            <li>Wash your entrecote in a bowl with olive oil and wait for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Heat the griddle until it reaches 200-220 degrees (If you don't have thermometer you can hold your hand over the griddle for 
            5 seconds. If you can't hold your hand more you should move to next step.
            </li>
            <li>Add some salt to the griddle. (Yes, not to entrecote.)</li>
            <li>Add some black pepper to the entrecote.</li>
            <li>Put your entrecote to the griddle and wait for 2 minutes. (Don't touch while grilling.)</li>
            <li>Turn your entrecote 90 degrees while grilling the same side. (Because same side needs more grilling and we want some grill marks :) )</li>
            <li> Add some salt and black pepper to not grilled side and turn the entrecote to start grill other side.</li>
            <li>Follow the 6th and 7th steps again and voila! Your juicy, tasty and soft entrecote is ready to eat :) </li>
        </ol>
